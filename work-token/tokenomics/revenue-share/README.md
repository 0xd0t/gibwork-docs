# Revenue Share

Our revenue-sharing model is designed to reward token holders by distributing a portion of the companyâ€™s revenue directly to them.&#x20;

Revenue-sharing distributions are organized into distinct "Seasons," each spanning a period of 12 weeks. This structured approach allows for consistent and predictable distribution timelines.

### Seasons

Each Season is carefully monitored and evaluated to ensure fair and transparent allocation of revenue, reinforcing our commitment to community engagement and sustainability.
