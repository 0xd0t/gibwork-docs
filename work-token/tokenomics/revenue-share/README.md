# Revenue Share

Our revenue-sharing model is designed to reward token holders by distributing a portion of the companyâ€™s revenue directly to them.&#x20;

Revenue-sharing distributions are organized into distinct "Seasons," each spanning a period of 12 weeks. This structured approach allows for consistent and predictable distribution timelines.

### Seasons

Revenue sharing is structured into distinct Seasons, allowing us to systematically assess performance and adjust our approach as needed.

Each Season is carefully monitored and evaluated to ensure fair and transparent allocation of revenue, reinforcing our commitment to community engagement and sustainability.
