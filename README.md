# Introduction

## What is Gibwork?

Gibwork was created 2023 during the [Solana Hyperdrive hackathon](https://solana.com/news/solana-hyperdrive-hackathon-winners), an online competition focused on bringing the next wave of high-impact projects into the Solana ecosystem. Hyperdrive was the eighth Solana hackathon, bringing together founders and developers from around the world to launch products spanning Infrastructure, Mobile Consumer Apps, Payments, DAOs, AI, and everything in-between.&#x20;

Hyperdrive saw more than 7,000 participants submit 907 final projects to the judges, making it one of the largest online Solana hackathons. Although the Gibwork team did not win any prizes, the judges recognized their work with an honorable mention.

## Gibwork v1.0

Shortly after the hackathon, the Gibwork team launched a beta version and successfully connected several opportunities with projects such as the Anchor framework, SolanaCiv, PubKey, Token Gator, and other Solana initiatives.
