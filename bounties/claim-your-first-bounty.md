# Claim your first bounty

As we navigate through this public beta and thoroughly test the platform, we've introduced a beginner bounty. This initiative enables open-source contributors to claim rewards and earn points by adding their name to a readme file, serving as an introduction to the platform.

1.  Log onto the platform [https://app.gib.work](https://app.gib.work) and select either Automated _(preferred)_ or Manual and sign-in using your Github account.\
